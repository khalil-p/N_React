Ques-1) WHAT IS EMMET?
Ans-1)  Use Emmet to improve workflow by speeding up coding and editing in (X)HTML, CSS, XML, XSL
        and JSP files. Emmet speeds coding by transforming abbreviations into blocks of
        structured code and improves editing with better code navigation and selection.

Ques-2) DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A LIBRARY AND A FRAMEWORK ?
Ans-2)
        LIBRARY:
        1.  Libraries provide developers with predefined functions and classes to make
            their work easier and boost the development process.
        2.  It is possible to call a library out of context. You may use the library wherever you
            see fit in your code.
        3.  It is easy to replace a library with another library. For instance, if you do not
            like the jQuery date picker library, you can use another date picker like a bootstrap
            date picker or pick date.
        4.  Less code is required to build libraries, which leads to faster loading times and
            better performance.

        FRAMEWORK:

        1.  Framework, on the other hand, is like the foundation upon which developers build
            applications for specific platforms.
        2.  On the other hand, you can only call and use what belongs to a Framework within the
            same Framework. 
        3.  Frameworks are difficult to replace. If, for instance, you were using AngularJS to
            build your product, you cannot simply swap it out for another framework. It requires
            rewriting the entire codebase. 
        4.  Developing a framework requires a lot of coding, which increases loading times and
            decreases performance.

Ques-3) WHAT IS CDN AND WHY DO WE USE IT?
Ans-3)  CDN is Content Delivery Network.
        A content delivery network (CDN) is a network of caching servers (edge servers/PoPs) that
        serve digital content from locations that are geographically closest to visitors. CDN
        server, Edge location, Point of Presence(PoP) meaning. These locations contain many
        caching servers that reduce the distance data must travel.Generally CDN is ot used in Production.
